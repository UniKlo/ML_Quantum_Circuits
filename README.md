# ML_Quantum_Circuits

**Objective

I have a QC based on 5 qubits. Each qubit has 2 states. Thus QC has 32 states in total. After each run, the QC will generate one state out of 32 states. After running the QC for 1024 times, we can have a histogram for how many times each state has been used.

My objective is to machine learning to predict the histogram.
**Data

100K randomly generated QCs based on 5 qubits and their histograms.
